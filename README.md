### Project Overview:

This project aimed to identify key health factors influencing heart disease and provide data-driven insights for early diagnosis.

### Dataset:

The dataset contains various health-related features of patients, including: 

sex: Sex of the patient (1= Male, 0 = Female)
cp: Chest pain type (4 types: 3= Asymptomatic,1=  Atypical Angina, 2= Non-angina pain, 0= Typical Angina)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1= True, 0= False)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 2= Lenticular Hypertrophy, 0= Normal, 1= ST-T wave Abnormality)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1= Yes; 0= No)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (0= Normal; 1= Fixed defect; 2= Reversible defect 3=No  )
target: Presence of heart disease (0= Yes, 1= No)

### Key Insights:

1. The average age of the patients is 54. Majority of the patients are male and the common type of chest pain experienced is the Typical Angina.
2. About half (49%) of the patients are categorized as "No-Risk," while the other half (51%) are "At-Risk." This indicates a balanced distribution, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and preventative measures for at-risk individuals..
3. People with Typical Angina chest pain are at a significantly higher risk of heart disease.
4. High fasting blood sugar levels diabetes(153 patients) are indicative of which significantly increases the risk of heart disease.
5. The average Cholesterol Level is 246mg/dL .High cholesterol levels are a known risk factor for heart disease, and monitoring and managing cholesterol through diet, exercise, and medication is crucial for heart health.
6. 513 patients have ST-T wave abnormalities, indicating a significant portion has irregular heart activity.

### Conclusion:
The project offers a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing heart disease, providing valuable insights into patient risk profiles.
